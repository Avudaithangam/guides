HTML Form is used to send the data(text,image,file...) to server, **Just sending data to server is not enough**, it is good to send data in correct format, so that we can avoid unwanted clients to server interactions.

Earlier HTML Form data are validated using **Events**(onChange, onClick...) and **Scripts**(by manipulating HTML DOM elements using ids or names) but in **HTML5** built-in attributes(Pattern,max,min,step) are added to validate the form data.
       - Minimum and Maximum length of the data
       - whether it is number, email, mandatory 
       - Regular expressions
